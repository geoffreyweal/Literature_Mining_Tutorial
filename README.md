## What is this Literature Mining Tutorial About

This tutorial will show you how to mine data from scientific papers using Python. We will use scripts for gathering papers, extracting and analysing text, and for highlighting keywords. 

This tutorial does not require any programming knowledge prior to the tutorial. 

## Google Colab and Python

Google Colab is a online tool that allows you to create a notebook that allows you to write Python, Julia, and R code, along with notes about what the code does. 

We will be running this tutorial in Google Colab, using Python to run commands. Python is a programming language that contains lots of helpful packages for mining data from scientific papers. 


## Instructions to Begin this Tutorial

Click on each notebook below that you want to open in Google Colab. The notebooks are designed to be consecutively followed. 

Each time you open a Google Colab Notebook, make sure you save a copy of the notebook to your Google Drive. Instructions for how to do this will be given in the preamble of each notebook.

**RECOMMENDED**: Right click each link as you go, one at a time, as a new tab in your browser.

## What is the Centre of Integrated Data Materials Science (iDM)

The Centre of Integrated Data Materials Science (iDM) is a new relationship between the Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences (iCeMS) at Kyoto University and the MacDiarmid Institute, involving several universities across New Zealand. The iDM aims to deepen the paradigm of data-driven materials science while aiming to establish a next-generation materials development process. See the following websites for more information:
