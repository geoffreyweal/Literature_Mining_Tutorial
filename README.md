## What is this Literature Mining Tutorial About

This tutorial will show you how to mine data from scientific papers using Python. We will use scripts for gathering papers, extracting and analysing text, and for highlighting keywords. 

This tutorial does not require any programming knowledge prior to the tutorial. 

## What is the Centre of Integrated Data Materials Science (iDM)

The Centre of Integrated Data Materials Science (iDM) is a new relationship between the Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences (iCeMS) at Kyoto University and the MacDiarmid Institute, involving several universities across New Zealand. iDM aims to deepen the paradigm of data-driven materials science while aiming to establish a next-generation materials development process. See the following websites for more information:

The Electronic Crystal Calculation Prep program is designed to provide information about the molecules in a OPV crystal structure, as well as dimer between individual molecules. While this program was originally designed for OPV crystal, it can be used for a crystal made of any chemical system. 


## Installation

It is recommended that you install a release version of the ECCP program, as these release versions are tested to make sure they (hopefully) run properly before they are released. You can find out how to install a release version of ECCP program on the installation page of the ECCP documentation in the link below: 

[eccp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html](https://eccp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html)

This includes instructions on how to clone the latest releast version of ECCP from Github. Note that you can install ECCP through ``pip3`` and ``conda``. 


## Where can I find the documentation for ECCP program

All the information about this program is found online at [eccp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://eccp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Click the button below to also see the documentation:

## Other Issues

This program is definitely a "work in progress". I have made it as easy to use as possible, but there are always oversights to program development and some parts of it may not be as easy to use as it could be. If you have any issues with the program or you think there would be better/easier ways to use and implement things in the Electronic Crystal Calculation Prep program, feel free to email Geoffrey about these (geoffrey.weal@gmail.com). Feedback is very much welcome!
